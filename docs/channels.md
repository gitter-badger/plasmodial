There are 5 transaction types:
2 that need to be signed by both: channel_new, channel_team_close,
and 3 that are signed by one: channel_solo_close, channel_slash, channel_timeout

If your partner disappears, and you want to close the channel, then you first publish a solo_close, which gives the current state of the channel, which is defined by a turing complete contract that outputs a nonce.
The contract is split into 2 parts, the scriptpubkey part, which both participants signed, and the scripsig part, which only one signed.

If your partner sees you publish a solo_close that doesn't output the highest nonce possible, then they can do a channel_slash transaction that outputs a higher nonce, and this becomes the final state that the channel gets closed at.

If your partner doesn't slash you, then eventually you can do a channel_timeout transaction, which closes the channel at the state from the solo_close.

The data that gets recorded on-chain for each channel is:
How much money is in the channel. The 2 accounts ids that control the channel.

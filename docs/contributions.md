Thank you for your interest in Aeternity.
There are issues on the github that need taking care of: https://github.com/aeternity/testnet/issues
Erlang is a rewarding language http://learnyousomeerlang.com/content
You can help us plenty without learning Erlang, we have lots of javascript that needs to be written.
If you have any questions about Aeternity or blockchain technology, feel free to email me: zack@aeternity.com

If you type up a proposal for an improvement you can make, and send the proposal to me, then Aeternity can offer you a bitcoin or ether prize for writing the code.

Simply installing the software and syncing up with the testnet can be a big help, if you find a bug.

Cheers,
Zack

The channels in Aeternity are more scalable for 2 reasons.
1) Channels move computation off-chain, so we can parallelize the smart contracts. So there is no limit to the amount of smart contract computation that can happen per second. Ethereum channels also have this capability.
2) The channels don't share state, so we can process all the channel-transactions in a block in parallel. So there is no limit to the volume of channels that can be closed and opened per second. Ethereum channels do not have this capability.
